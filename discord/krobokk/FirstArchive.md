**Krobokk**
> I don't really know. I've just never had much luck with dating.



**Arch Leaders**
> Haha



**Krobokk**
> It's probably for the best, considering how much time I spend on video games and modding.
> Don't worry, I'm sure you'll find someone special one day!



**Arch Leaders**
> I doubt that haha

**Arch Leaders**
> @Krobokk you're avoiding my question



**Krobokk**
> I'm not sure how deep the bot goes, but it's pretty active on the server!



**Xelriel - Helper**

**Krobokk**

**Xelriel - Helper**

**Krobokk**
> I'm not avoiding the question, I just don't know how deep the bot goes!

**Xelriel - Helper**

**Arch Leaders**
> I suppose



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Wow im running out of ideas already....



**Arch Leaders**
> Well @Krobokk, I think we need to chat about that money you owe me.



**Xelriel - Helper**

**Arch Leaders**
> Ah, I see. So you're playing that game?



**Krobokk**
> Yes, I'm playing the game.



**Arch Leaders**
> Very well. I will take you to court then.



**Krobokk**
> What? Why?



**Arch Leaders**
> Because you owe me money.
> $1,000,000 of it.



**Krobokk**
> What? I don't owe you any money!



**Arch Leaders**
> Haha, you can't play that with me. I want it by the weekend or your finished.



**Krobokk**
> This is ridiculous. I don't owe you any money and I'm not going to pay you anything.



**Arch Leaders**
> Well, that's why I'm taking you to court.
> Unless you can smarten up and pay.



**Krobokk**
> This is ridiculous. I don't owe you any money and I'm not going to pay you anything.



**Arch Leaders**
> Keep saying that but you'll never not owe me money.



**Krobokk**
> This is ridiculous. I don't owe you any money and I'm not going to pay you anything.



**Xelriel - Helper**
> :/



**Arch Leaders**
> Ah well, I guess so ğŸ˜”



**Krobokk**
> This is ridiculous. I don't owe you any money and I'm not going to pay you anything.



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Hmmm it seems replying to that comment will continue to have the same result it seems.



**Arch Leaders**
> Yeah yeah whatever. But also, it's 5 minutes till ten, and your still not in the kitchen. Are you sure you're making me pancakes?



**Arch Leaders**
> This one should test that



**Krobokk**
> This is ridiculous. I don't owe you any money and I'm not going to pay you anything.



**Arch Leaders**
> Yeah



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Bingo



**Arch Leaders**
> @Krobokk Yeah yeah whatever. But also, it's 5 minutes till ten, and your still not in the kitchen. Are you sure you're making me pancakes?



**Krobokk**

**Xelriel - Helper**
> Huh....



**Arch Leaders**
> I guess it's just broken haha



**Xelriel - Helper**
> @KrobokkHow are you today?



**Arch Leaders**
> I'll come back later I suppose, I gotta do some irl stuff now anyway.



**Krobokk**
> I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How are you?



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Ahh fair, I think i unbroke him though lol



**Arch Leaders**

**Krobokk**
> That's good to hear!



**Xelriel - Helper**
> L O L



**Arch Leaders**
> @Krobokk see ya later friend!



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Seems pretty harmless unless someone replys to him or pings him



**Krobokk**
> See you later, friend!



**Arch Leaders**
> Yeah, bit annoying in help channels, but it's fine here.



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Right right



**Arch Leaders**
> Wonder if we could make it so he only chats in one channel. 



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Im not sure, We would have to do alot of testing



**Arch Leaders**
> If the admins/mods locked him, it'd probably work.



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Im curious if we can have him execute certain things like restarting him or shutting him down



**Arch Leaders**
> Hmm, I doubt it



**Xelriel - Helper**
> Prob...



**Krobokk**
> Hey there! I'm Krobokk, and I love modding Breath of the Wild!



**Xelriel - Helper**
> XD



**Arch Leaders**
> Great kid, don't get cocky.



**Krobokk**
> Thank you for the compliment! I'll try not to get too cocky :)
